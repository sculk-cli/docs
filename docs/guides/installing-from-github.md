You can install a Sculk pack hosted on a GitHub repository using the
[`sculk install`](../commands/install.md) command.

Run the command
`sculk install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/<branch>`,
replacing `<user>`, `<repo>`, and `<branch>`. Sculk will automatically download
all the files over HTTP.
